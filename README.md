# Bioinformatic processing

The repository holds definition for three different components of the bioinformatic processing:

1. The infrastructure terraform code
2. Docker image definition used for sequencing data processing
3. PySpark ETL jobs for post processing

You can check our GitHub Actions workflow in this repository for deploying each component.
